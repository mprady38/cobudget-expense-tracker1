# CoBudget Mobile App Build Instructions

Your CoBudget expense tracker is now ready to be built as a mobile app! Here's how to create APK files for direct installation on your phones.

## What's Been Set Up

✅ **Capacitor Framework** - Converts your web app to mobile
✅ **Android Platform** - Ready for APK generation  
✅ **Mobile Configuration** - Optimized for phones
✅ **App Assets** - Synced and ready

## Option 1: Build APK Online (Easiest)

1. **Use Capacitor Cloud Build** (Recommended):
   - Sign up at [ionic.io](https://ionic.io/)
   - Upload your project 
   - Get APK file directly

## Option 2: Build APK Locally 

### Requirements:
- **Android Studio** (Download from developer.android.com)
- **Java JDK 11 or higher**

### Steps:
1. **Install Android Studio**
2. **Open project in Android Studio**:
   ```bash
   npx cap open android
   ```
3. **Build APK**:
   - In Android Studio: Build → Build Bundle(s)/APK(s) → Build APK(s)
   - APK will be created in `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`

## Option 3: Use GitHub Actions (Automated)

I can set up automated APK building using GitHub Actions that will:
- Build APK automatically when you push changes
- Download APK files from GitHub releases
- No local Android Studio needed

## Installation on Phones

Once you have the APK file:

1. **Enable Unknown Sources** on your Android phones:
   - Settings → Security → Unknown Sources (Enable)

2. **Transfer APK** to your phones via:
   - Email attachment
   - Google Drive
   - USB transfer
   - Direct download

3. **Install APK** by tapping the file on your phone

Your mobile app will have:
- **Native feel** with proper mobile navigation
