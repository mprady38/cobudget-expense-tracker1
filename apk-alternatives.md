# CoBudget APK Generation - Updated Options

Since Ionic Appflow was discontinued in February 2025, here are your current options:

## Option 1: VoltBuilder (Recommended - Easiest)

VoltBuilder is the direct replacement for Ionic Appflow:

1. **Go to**: [volt.build](https://volt.build)
2. **Sign up** for free account
3. **Upload your project**:
   - Create ZIP with: `android/`, `dist/`, `capacitor.config.ts`, `package.json`
4. **Build APK**: Click "Build" → Download APK
5. **Cost**: Free tier available, simple pricing

## Option 2: GitHub Actions (Automated)

I can set up automated APK building in GitHub:

1. **Push your code** to GitHub repository
2. **Automatic builds** trigger on every change
3. **Download APK** from GitHub Actions or Releases
4. **Free** with GitHub account

## Option 3: Local Android Studio

Traditional method:

1. **Install Android Studio**
2. **Run**: `npx cap open android`
3. **Build**: Build → Build Bundle(s)/APK(s) → Build APK(s)
4. **Find APK**: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`

## Quick Start: VoltBuilder Method

Since VoltBuilder is specifically designed to replace Appflow:

### Step 1: Prepare Files
Your project already has everything needed. Create a ZIP file with:
- `android/` folder (complete)
- `dist/` folder (your built web app)
- `capacitor.config.ts`
- `package.json`

### Step 2: Upload and Build
1. Visit volt.build and create account
2. Upload the ZIP file
3. Select "Build Android APK"
4. Download the generated APK file

### Step 3: Install on Phones
1. Enable "Install unknown apps" in Android settings
2. Transfer APK to both phones
3. Tap to install CoBudget

## File Preparation Script

Let me prepare your files for upload:

```bash
# Create the ZIP file for VoltBuilder
zip -r cobudget-mobile.zip android/ dist/ capacitor.config.ts package.json ionic.config.json
```

Would you like me to:
1. Set up GitHub Actions for automated builds, or
2. Help you prepare files for VoltBuilder upload?

VoltBuilder is probably the fastest option since it works exactly like the old Ionic Appflow.
